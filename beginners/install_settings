To make python run in windows

Download Python from https://www.python.org/getit/ and install using download exe file.

After installation check the path in program files if their is folder or not otherwise check "C:\users\appdata\local\programs\python7-32" you will find the path.

Check the environment variables if the path is present or not otherwise replace the path and check the python versin in power shell or cmd using "python --version".

If it successfully installed we will get the version name.

After that check the "easy_install --version" if you dint get repeat the same as above copy the path if script folder from python folder and add in env variables.

Because using easy_install only we will add packages now create django project.
